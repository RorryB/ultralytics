## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

First, clone the Ultralytics repository and navigate to the example directory. Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary dependencies like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

```bash
# Clone the ultralytics repository
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

# Navigate to the example directory
cd ultralytics/examples/YOLOv8-Region-Counter

# Install required open source packages (if not already installed)
pip install ultralytics perforatedai

```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Train on COCO with Ultralytics YOLOv11 Dendritic

Execute the script using the following command

```bash
# Run the training script
python yolov11_dendritic_coco.py
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Dendritic Optimization?

The artificial neuron was invented in 1943, and it hasn't evolved since. That outdated model still powers today's AI.  Modern neuroscience shows that biological dendrites, not neurons, are the true workhorses of intelligence. Artificial dendrites offer a new path forward for ML engineers, overcoming the economic and technical limitations of legacy neural networks. Perforated's dendrite-enhanced neurons are the building blocks of AI 2.0, empowering each individual neuron in your model to achieve better decisions on the same dataset with the same underlying architecture.

### Why Optimize YOLO with Dendrites?

Dendritic Intelligence can reduce the parameter count of networks by up to 90% with no loss in accuracy. This radically reduces hardware required deployment by up to 10X without impacting the final use case, or enables the accuracy of 10X bigger models onto your current hardware.

### How Can I Troubleshoot Issues?

For debugging, check out the [PyTorch Dendritic AI GitHub](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI) or get in touch through their [website](https://www.perforatedai.com).
